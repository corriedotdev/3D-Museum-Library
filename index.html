          This gown is a reproduction of a saque (or sack) back gown from the 18th century, also called a robe à la française (French dress). There is a complicated arrangement of pleats on the back of the gown that flows to the floor with a short train. This differs from the British style where eh back is fitted to the body.  The gown is made in silk taffeta , with silk taffeta petticoat, silk brocade stomacher with chemise, corset and panniers underneath.

          <p>It was expected that Scottish landowners would raise volunteer fencible units (from the word defencible) for
            defence against the threat of invasion during the Seven Years' War, the American War of Independence and French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th 
            century. Usually temporary units, composed of clan members their role was, 
            as their name suggests, usually confined to garrison and patrol duties, freeing up the regular Army units to perform offensive operations. </p>

          <H1>Clan Grant Wedding Dress</H1>
          <p>
            The Clan Grant Wedding Dress was inspired by the Isabella MacTavish Fraser wedding dress at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. It is the only 18th century wedding gown in tartan known to exist. Fixed clan tartan didn’t exist in the same way as today, colours and patterns of plaid changed according to a weaver’s design and which plants were available in certain areas. People’s location rather than their clan affiliation decided which tartan was generally worn. 
            This dress in Grant tartan has a navy linen petticoat and stomacher. The back of the dress is made up of a single rectangle of fabric that has been pleated into the shape of the body.

                <H1>Christening Gown, 1899</H1>
                <p>This christening gown is made from silk and lace. It was donated to the Highland Museum of Childhood by Diana MacDowell and was made by her great-grandmother in 1899 for the christening of Diana’s mother, Eileen May. 
                  Traditionally, christening gowns have been passed from generation to generation for hundreds of years – for some families, this is an important way of preserving the family's history and faith. 
                  Diana wore the gown for her christening in 1927 and then her sons, Andrew and Hamish wore it in the 1960s.
