          <p>Moving into the regency period which is commonly applied to the years between c. 1795 and 1837, although the official regency for which it is named only spanned the years 1811 to 1820. King George III first suffered debilitating illness in the late 1780s, 
            and relapsed into his final mental illness in 1810; by the Regency Act 1811, his eldest son George, Prince of Wales, was appointed prince regent to discharge royal functions. </p>

          <H1>Victorian Wedding Dress, 1991</H1>
          <p>This Victorian ‘bustle’ wedding dress was made for Miss Agnes Helen Gordon on her marriage to Donald MacDougall in 1882. Agnes’s wedding dress is beautifully made, perfectly fitted and the height of fashion for the period. The fitted bodice with a high neckline sits over an elaborate overskirt draped on a bustle with train of cascading ruffles. The Bustle was making a comeback in the 1880s after the large 
            crinoline skirt had replaced the fashion of the early Victorian era. It was made by gathering the skirt fabric into a ‘bustle’ held over a pad or frame. </p>
            <p>
              The wedding dress features in a brilliant online exhibition of Highland Costume <a href="https://highlandthreads.co.uk/">HERE</a>

                <H1>Child's Traditional Highland Dress, c1900</H1>
                <p>This child’s traditional Highland Dress outfit was made by Gardiner & Company of the Scotch House, London, 
                  possibly in the late 19th or early 20th century. It consists of a woollen tartan kilt and plaid, 
                  velvet waistcoat and jacket and leather and horsehair sporran. This costume is typical of that worn by boys of wealthy Victorian 
                  families and would have been kept as ‘best dress’ for special occasions.
